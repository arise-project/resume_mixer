Aspose: 

I worked in free web applications outsourcing team for document conversion using Aspose libraries and helped migrate it to microservices and developed automatic unit test coverage by sitemap. All apps are processing several terabytes of user documents in a month all over the world. My teammates were from Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. Often fixes were made even at night and on weekends in order to improve the main indicator, the number of users who were able to process documents within a month. Developed architecture for storing processing statuses in Redis, services to monitor health of apps, aggregate analytics to identify weaknesses in design and broken functionality, Hugo markup translation utility for 30 languages that used rules to find paragraphs of text to save to Toml and replace the text with keys, Doing SEO research for the texts of each new app, created a service for sending out emails with alerts about critical situations in applications.

Oracle: 

I maintained the Maxynizer product and participated in the development of the new Recommender product in terms of filtering recommendations based on user preferences. I learned the java language for microservices. The code was checked by two reviewers and run through detailed testing by a teammates. We used async tasks to improve CPU utilization and an in-memory TimesTen database to support high-load microservices. I listened to lectures on corporate culture, equity and equality for me.

Webinerds: 

I developed components for collecting data from products integrated in the companies (Abacus, Powerpoint, Active Directory AWS S3) to enteprise search. I learned the PHP programming language and developed a plugin to migrate user data from Nextcloud. I second project we maintained an administrative panel, for customer service and accountants, in which we could manage the creation of custom product and sending it to customer. In order to get the most correct tax reporting, we used several analytics services. I created a module for sending promotional and congratulatory letters to web store customers. To do this collaborated with managers from Germany and the Saudi Emirates.

Private: 

I developed software for the control board and utilities for analyzing messages with peripherals. Studied the interoperability paradigm between software and electronics tools to test the speed of applications when interacting with peripherals. I created Mobdus Sniffer software and developed architecture of modular application for messaging within a process. I studied NASA's experience with modular architecture. I optimized the GPIO stack to work with Realtime Linux and take telemetry with nanosecond delays. I set ist of tasks for myself with the goal of getting maximum progress for each day.

--------------

Altium: 

I with a team were migrating the PCB designer from Delphy to C# WPF. I studied the Object Pascal programming language specification, learned the interoperability between COM+ components and managed code and used event queues to update UI components.

--------------

Daxx: 

I maintained software as outsourcer for a set of operator workstations for loading and unloading grain at USA grain elevators. This software is for effective control of grain delivery to elevator by weight and quality meassurmen and automatic system to keep track of grain bin occupancy. I spent time to fix bugs that first needed to be reproduced with Gherkin scenarios., invoke UI from background threads. We held all meetings, including retrospectives, with the customer in English.

--------------

Riversand: 

With development team I created a prasers and data normalization rules to export vehicle parts data a meta database. Did do this we used a templated code structure and multi-threaded data file processing. I was involved in passing a job for a manager from India.

--------------

Luxoft: 

I workead as outsourse software engineer with a set of apps serving funded pensions and developed a mobile html application for deposit management. Main part of software is financial portals for representatives, including 404 insurance and clients for buying and selling financial products and stocks. The reliability of the code was ensured by a declarative development approach and covering of a logic with unit tests.

--------------

GConnect: 

I was extending the marketing portal modules to send bonus emails to post and insurance company users, bounty for insurance company clients and the Post Office. I was developed backend for a visual javascript editor to create marketing emails.

--------------

Microwave: 

On a Ukrainian project for local grain processing plants I developed software for the operator to control the moisture and temperature of raw materials. For did this I extended data bus for modbus protocol, which allowed efficient parallel operation of up to 5 devices on one RS-485 line, learned .NET Managed C++ and was using dynamic polymorphism to develop the Modbus driver in the managed code. I went to a grain processing plant to make molasses for candy to see how software works on the plant.

--------------

Astra: 

I worked with the team in software company that developed Call center for hardware sip phones and software sip. Client-server application was used for insurance, healthcare, and sales. We implemented sip messages queue design based on thread pool. I used an algorithmic method to find deadlocks on logs. I interacted with QA to clarify issues. We supported and expanded the functionality of the call center, used dependency injection enterprise application architectures from Microsoft and event driven architecture with callbacks.

--------------

Softserve: 

I was working on an internal time tracker for developers where I studied building browser-based time tracker client applications and programming language javascript.

--------------

Imagineer: 

As outsorsing developer I wrote a website with reports on data from wearable devices for measuring blood pressure.Used the client ASP.NET server architecture and form interaction with code Behind. Studied the programming language VB.NET to wrote reports. I involved in development a desktop program for hedge fund client reports. The application I worked on created reports for clients about the current state of their finances in the hedge fund.

ITStep: 

I worked as a c++ teacher at a private academy for all ages, from schoolchildren to retirees. All sessions were hands-on at the computers. I prepared a set of code solves for comprehension to show how c++ works. I showed the solution to problems on the blackboard and answered questions about how it works. Templates were used for a more elegant implementation of the data structures. I use ANSI C and Visual C++.
